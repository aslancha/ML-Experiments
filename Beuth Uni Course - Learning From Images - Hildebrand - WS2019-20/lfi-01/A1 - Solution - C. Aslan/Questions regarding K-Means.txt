a) What are the problems of this clustering algorithm?
Since the initialization is random, every new clustering can have different clusters.
Another problem is the number of clusters. If the number of clusters are not optimal, the instability is even bigger.

b) How can I improve the results?
Test different numbers of clusters k for a certain number of iterations and choose the k with the lowest  mean instabilty.
